        <h2>Nail art: the best designs you'll see this Spring</h2>
    </div>

        <p>
            It’s never too early to start thinking about what spring nail art we want to try once the weather 
            warms up. Let’s call it manifesting. Nail enthusiasts are familiar with the high that comes with 
            romanticizing those fun designs and mixing and matching bright colors for the upcoming season, so why 
            not indulge in those good feels now?
        </p>
        <p>
            This spring we can expect to see classic pastel shades as well as fun finishes like chrome, pearl, and 
            loads of shimmer. Florals, naturally, are a must, as are gingham prints and French tips. But you can expect 
            lots of psychedelic and retro-inspired designs, as well as metallic 3D art to make your typical spring nail a 
            little bit more exciting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lets see five of our favourite trends for this early spring:
        </p>

    <div class="nails">
        <div class="gilmore_image">
            <img src="./imagenes/lifestyle/fruity.jpg" alt="Fruity Nails">
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                First of all, here we have a classic from the beggining of the decade, fruity nails are a gen z fav since its always 
                a funny and fresh design in which we all can play with different combinations.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="nails">
        <div class="gilmore_image">
            <img src="./imagenes/lifestyle/floral.jpg" alt="Floral Nails">
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Second trend it's also a clasic, but, who doesn't enjoy a dainty floral design? Exactly, we all do, it's fresh, it's 
                femenine, it's simply beautiful (And with clear base we can also enjoy of a low maintenance nail art)
            </p>
        </div>

    <div class="nails">
        <div class="gilmore_image">
            <img src="./imagenes/lifestyle/glitter.jpg" alt="Glittery nails">
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Half the way thorugh this article, we can find something as shiny as you, shimmer is so girly and so in trend, we can use it 
                everywhere, from The Eras Tour to your everyday outfit for school. Glitter is never enough!
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="nails">
        <div class="gilmore_image">
            <img src="./imagenes/lifestyle/minimal.jpg" alt="Minimal nails">
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Sometimes we are just not in the mood for have such a big design, or a complicated one, but that doesn't mean we have to get bare natural 
                nails when we dont have too much happening in our nails, for that moments I rocommend minimal designs, and sure, minimal designs can also have 
                pops of color!
            </p>
        </div>

    <div class="nails">
        <div class="gilmore_image">
            <img src="./imagenes/lifestyle/waves.jpg" alt="Chunky waves">
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Last but not worse, chunky waves still on trend, take a chance on this funny and careless style to combine with your most basic outfits or with your 
                trendiest colorful dress.
