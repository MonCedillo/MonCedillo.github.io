            i am myself a spring baby and i really enjoy this season; it's on the little things: the flowers, the sun and the 
            smell of the air!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            And, you know hoy spring can be better? Yes!, reading a book by the seaside while sipping on a piña colada, smellng 
            the salt air and bathing in the sunlight, cheeks flushed and tan skin. Can it be any more relaxing?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            So... for this month, my choosen one will be an all's favourite of several springs since their launch in 1911.

                her parents die in a cholera outbreak in India. Lonely and spoiled, Mary discovers a neglected garden on her

                Frances Hodgson Burnett's "The Secret Garden" is a timeless classic that beautifully explores themes of growth, 
                friendship, and the healing power of nature. Through rich storytelling and vivid imagery, Burnett transports readers 
                into the enchanting world of Misselthwaite Manor, where the magic of the secret garden unfolds. The characters are 
                deeply human, each carrying their own burdens and vulnerabilities, yet finding strength and solace in their connection 
                to the natural world. "The Secret Garden" reminds us of the transformative power of love, friendship, and the simple 
                joys of life, making it a must-read for both children and adults alike.

            <h3>About the autor</h3>
            <p>
                Frances Eliza Hodgson was the daughter of ironmonger Edwin Hodgson, who died three years after her birth, and his wife 
                Eliza Boond. She was educated at The Select Seminary for Young Ladies and Gentleman until the age of fifteen, at which 
                point the family ironmongery, then being run by her mother, failed, and the family emigrated to Knoxville, Tennessee. 
                Here Hodgson began to write, in order to supplement the family income, assuming full responsibility for the family upon 
                the death of her mother, in 1870. In 1872 she married Dr. Swan Burnett, with whom she had two sons, Lionel and Vivian. 
                The marriage was dissolved in 1898. In 1900 Burnett married actor Stephen Townsend until 1902 when they got divorced. 
                Following her great success as a novelist, playwright, and children's author, Burnett maintained homes in both England 
                and America, traveling back and forth quite frequently. She died in her Long Island, New York home, in 1924.

                Primarily remembered today for her trio of classic children's novels - Little Lord Fauntleroy (1886), A Little Princess 
                (1905), and The Secret Garden (1911) - Burnett was also a popular adult novelist, in her own day, publishing romantic 
                stories such as The Making of a Marchioness (1901) for older readers.
