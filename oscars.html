            If something has become clear to us until today, it's that, despite the passage of time, the Oscars are still 
            considered the ultimate event within the film industry. From the announcement of the nominations, the anticipated 
            red carpet, and the presence of celebrities of the moment under one roof, this evening has managed to establish itself 
            as a symbol of excellence that everyone who makes the seventh art a reality aspires to achieve with their work.
        </p>
        <p>
            The truth is that it's not necessary to be an avid cinephile to know that the Academy Awards have been marked by lessons 
            that transcend forever, and with the next edition of the award drawing closer, we gather some of the phrases that have marked 
            the most inspiring speeches at the Oscars.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this article, we will show you some of our favourites:

        <h4>1973 - Marlon Brando</h4>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2QUacU0I4yU?si=oFkdehTinn57Rhpn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </p>

            More than five decades since this event, the speech that adorned Marlon Brando's victory as Best Actor for "The Godfather" is 
            still considered one of the greatest acts of protest. Instead of taking the stage and accepting the statue with his name, Brando 
            asked Apache activist Sacheen Littlefeather to take his place and reject the award on behalf of the treatment Native Americans 
            received in the entertainment industry. However, the full speech was shared with the press. Through powerful words, the award-winning 
            actor made his message clear. "Put down your weapons, my friends, and thus we shall remain together. Only if you put down your weapons, 
            my friends, can we talk of peace and come to an agreement that will be beneficial to you."
        </p>

    <div class="oscars">
        <h4>2002 - Halle Berry</h4>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/llgL7mGYVTI?si=-4ApkC9bmuACp8Nw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </p>
        <p>
            With her participation in "Monster's Ball," Halle Berry became the first African American woman to win the Oscar for Best Leading Actress. 
            "This moment is so much bigger than me. This moment is for Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll. It's for the women that stand beside 
            me, Jada Pinkett, Angela Bassett, Vivica Fox. And it's for every nameless, faceless woman of color that now has a chance because this door tonight 
            has been opened."

        <h4>2009 - Heath Ledger</h4>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jrt2xoy5UHo?si=ZChbIz7GxyITWT3U" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            The death of Heath Ledger was one of the greatest tragedies of the contemporary industry. And just a few months after his passing, it was his family 
            who accepted the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in "The Dark Knight" on his behalf. His mother, Sally Bell, reminisced about her son's essence. "Heath 
            was such a compassionate and generous soul who added so much emotion and inspiration to our lives. We have been truly overwhelmed by the honor and respect 
            bestowed upon him with this award. Tonight, we choose to celebrate and be happy for what he achieved."

        <h4>2018 - Guillermo del Toro</h4>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_7p9p4F26_4?si=WcMe74HKms5sNhSJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite having three previous nominations before this triumphant moment, Guillermo del Toro won his first Oscar for Best Director for "The Shape of Water," 
            where he made clear the immense potential of Mexico with his inspiring speech about breaking down the barriers that divide us. "I am an immigrant, just like 
            Alfonso and Alejandro, my compadres. Just like Gael. Just like Salma. And just like many, many of you. And in the last twenty-five years, I have been living 
            in a country all of my own: part of it is here, part is in Europe, part is everywhere. Because I believe that the greatest thing our art and our industry do 
            is erase the lines in the sand. We should continue doing that when the world tells us to make them deeper."

        <h4>2023 - Michelle Yeoh</h4>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZldmL7zeSY?si=T7-P_BasjarVapFJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </p>
        <p>
            With her Best Actress award for "Everything Everywhere All At Once," Michelle Yeoh became the first Asian woman to win in this category. "For all the little 
            boys and girls who look like me, who are watching tonight, this is a beacon of hope and possibility. This is proof that... dream big, and dreams come true. 
            And women, don't let anyone tell you that your best days are behind you. Never give up," she shared about the importance of representation in this industry and 
            breaking the stigmas that claim women lose value after reaching a certain age.
