            Rory gilmore once said, and I really fell for that words just because it was so ME!. And when I tell you 
            I am that girl with a book everywhere se goes, I'm telling you the truth, from fantasy to horror and from Vogue to 
            Le Monde, I always feel the need to read as much as possible. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Gilmore Girls is for the girlies, for us girls who need a comfort place and character for us to identify on. And so a lot of us 
            found a role model on first season Rory Gilmore, which personality has a strong baseline on how in love she is with words and with books. 
            All through the series we can find and hear so many different references to literature that it would be a waste not to write a list of all the books 
            our Gilmore Girls read and so I did. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            And our book count for the list is... 519 books!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            So the challenge is to read as many books of the list you want and you can, read as fast as you can because this list is rich in classics and in contemporanean literature 
            from self help to children's books and from chilenian to american writers. Get comfy, click on the links below and and grab your first book of the challenge now.
