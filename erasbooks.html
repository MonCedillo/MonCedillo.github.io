                Hello fellow swifties, well, the other night I was completely absorted with some of the songs written by our queen Taylor Swift and 
                I couldn't help thinking of the album I was listening to as a book, like, "If this album was a book, which one would it be?" and I started this 
                thing of naming each Taylor's era as a book merely like a game, but turns out that was a great idea, from there I started to think 
                every one of the songs in a very different way, with a new perspective.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
            So I thought it'd be so funny to share my veredicts with you, in part it was because I wanted to know if you all agree with my choses and the other part 
            because I thought this would turn into a "One book a month" challenge, with her albums we are able to take this challenge for almost one year... ¿what do we think?

            <h4>Debut era as: To kill a mockingbird by Harper Lee</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Like Harper Lee's classic, Taylor's debut era captures the essence of small-town life, with its innocence, coming-of-age themes, and poignant storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
                The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it. "To Kill A Mockingbird" became both an instant
                 bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning 
                 film, also a classic.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, "To Kill A Mockingbird" takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, 
                love and hatred, humor and pathos.

            <h4>Fearless era as: Pride and Perjudice</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Austen's vision of love, growth and society reminds us to Taylor's storytelling all through fearless, she talks of life the way she's experiencing it and the way she percieves 
                it from the experience of those ones close to her. Austen and Swift share a special kind of irony to talk about the world and the love.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since its immediate success in 1813, Pride and Prejudice has remained one of the most popular novels in the English language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work 
                "her own darling child" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print." The romantic clash between the opinionated 
                Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate 
                quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.

            <h4>Speak now era as: Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                As well as Swift's third studio album, Jane Eyre is a masterpiece bout speaking one's truth and defying societal expectations, much like the protagonist of "Jane Eyre." 
                Both stories feature strong-willed heroines who assert their independence and follow their hearts despite the odds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Charlotte Brontë tells the story of orphaned Jane Eyre, who grows up in the home of her heartless aunt, enduring loneliness and cruelty. This troubled childhood strengthens 
                Jane's natural independence and spirit - which prove necessary when she finds employment as a governess to the young ward of Byronic, brooding Mr Rochester. As her feelings 
                for Rochester develop, Jane gradually uncovers Thornfield Hall's terrible secret, forcing her to make a choice. Should she stay with Rochester and live with the consequences, 
                or follow her convictions - even if it means leaving the man she loves? A novel of intense power and intrigue, Jane Eyre dazzled readers with its passionate depiction of a 
                woman's search for equality and freedom.

            <h4>Red era as: Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                "Red" by Taylor Swift is known for its exploration of intense emotions, passionate relationships, and tumultuous experiences of love and heartbreak. "Wuthering Heights" by 
                Emily Brontë shares many thematic elements with Taylor Swift's "Red" album, making it an apt comparison between intense emotions, turbulent relationships, longing, regret and 
                a dark atmosphere of drama.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the centre of this novel is the passionate love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff - recounted with such emotional intensity that a plain tale of the Yorkshire moors 
                acquires the depth and simplicity of ancient tragedy.

            <h4>1989 era as: The great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Comparing "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald to Taylor Swift's album "1989" might initially seem like a stretch, given the stark differences in medium and time period 
                but heir shared exploration of themes such as wealth, identity, love, and the passage of time allows for intriguing parallels to be drawn between them, parties, friends, loneliness 
                and broken hearts are present in both masterpieces.
            </p>
            <p>
                This exemplary novel of the Jazz Age has been acclaimed by generations of readers. The story of the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan, of 
                lavish parties on Long Island at a time when The New York Times noted "gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession," it is an exquisitely crafted tale of America in the 1920s.

                Overall, "Gone Girl" and Taylor Swift's "Reputation" era share a thematic resonance in their exploration of deception, perception, and the complexities of public image and personal identity. 
                They both share different perspectives on betrayal, love and society standards for a woman, and how they treat her by the way she acts, teh way she talks, teh way she lives. No one wills for a 
                woman to have such a revenge, and when they do, they do it the right way.

                Overall, "Me Before You" and Taylor Swift's "Lover" era complement each other well, offering nuanced portrayals of love, relationships, and the journey towards self-discovery and personal fulfillment. 
                But what if I tell you this both masterpieces are sad, beautiful and tragic; full of doubt and insecurities?

                Maybe this is my favourite established bond between a book and an album, "folklore" by Taylor Swift and "Normal People" by Sally Rooney share common themes of intimacy, vulnerability, 
                identity, and the complexity of human relationships, making them resonate with audiences who appreciate introspective and emotionally rich storytelling. Complex and intimate, this works 
                are both going to break your heart and make you feel part of the scenario.

                At school Connell and Marianne pretend not to know each other. He’s popular and well-adjusted, star of the school soccer team while she is lonely, proud, and intensely private. But when 
                Connell comes to pick his mother up from her housekeeping job at Marianne’s house, a strange and indelible connection grows between the two teenagers - one they are determined to conceal.
            </p>
            <p>
                A year later, they’re both studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Marianne has found her feet in a new social world while Connell hangs at the sidelines, shy and uncertain. Throughout their 
                years in college, Marianne and Connell circle one another, straying toward other people and possibilities but always magnetically, irresistibly drawn back together. Then, as she veers into 
                self-destruction and he begins to search for meaning elsewhere, each must confront how far they are willing to go to save the other.

                Sally Rooney brings her brilliant psychological acuity and perfectly spare prose to a story that explores the subtleties of class, the electricity of first love, and the complex entanglements

                In this book, under the influence of their charismatic classics professor, a group of clever, eccentric misfits at an elite New England college discover a way of thinking and living that 
                is a world away from the humdrum existence of their contemporaries. But when they go beyond the boundaries of normal morality they slip gradually from obsession to corruption and betrayal, 
                and at last—inexorably—into evil.

                "Bluets" by Maggie Nelson and Taylor Swift's album "Midnights" might seem like an odd pairing at first, given their different mediums and styles. However, both works delve into 
                themes of introspection, longing, and the complexities of human emotions.
            </p>
            <p>
                A lyrical, philosophical, and often explicit exploration of personal suffering and the limitations of vision and love, as refracted through the color blue. With Bluets, Maggie 
                Nelson has entered the pantheon of brilliant lyric essayists.

            <h4>The Tortured poets department era as: The bell jar by Sylvia Plath</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Here we are, at the very endo of the list, with my (maybe) favourite author and an album we hadn't even heard. But I bet this can be a good match since we have two or three clues on 
                the different versions of the album announced at the moment. The bell jar is a masterpiece of a woman's journey, self-doubt, self criticism, broken hearts and a pillow full of tears 
                making it something to help bearing the loneliness and the difficult world we all live in.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Bell Jar chronicles the crack-up of Esther Greenwood: brilliant, beautiful, enormously talented, and successful, but slowly going under—maybe for the last time. Sylvia Plath 
                masterfully draws the reader into Esther's breakdown with such intensity that Esther's insanity becomes completely real and even rational, as probable and accessible an experience as 
                going to the movies. Such deep penetration into the dark and harrowing corners of the psyche is an extraordinary accomplishment and has made The Bell Jar a haunting American classic.
